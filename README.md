# Java Learning Repository

## About this repository
This repository is dedicated to my Java learning journey. 
I will be pushing code that I have studied and written myself to track my progress and organize my learning materials.

## Goals
* Understand Java fundamentals and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
* Practice problem-solving using Java.
* Build a solid foundation for software development.
